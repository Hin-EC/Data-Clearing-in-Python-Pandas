# Data-Clearing-in-Python-Pandas

This project demonstrates various data-clearing techniques in **Python Pandas**. The goal is to showcase the steps involved in cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis. This is a conceptual guide that includes common data cleaning steps, such as handling null values, removing duplicates, handling outliers, replacing missing values with the mean, and changing data types.

The project contains a Jupyter notebook file that provides explanations and code examples for each of these steps.

## Project Overview

Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analysis process. In this project, we focus on the following steps for cleaning data using **Pandas**:

- Remove and replace null values
- Remove duplicated rows
- Handle and remove outliers
- Replace zero values with the mean and vice versa
- Change data types of columns

The project will guide you through these operations, offering explanations and examples along the way.

## Steps Covered

### 1. **Remove and Replace Null Values**

- Handle missing data by either dropping rows with null values or replacing them with a specific value (e.g., mean, median).

### 2. **Remove Duplicated Rows**

- Identify and remove duplicate rows to ensure that the dataset contains unique entries.

### 3. **Remove Outliers**

- Identify and remove outliers in the dataset, using techniques like IQR (Interquartile Range) methods.

### 4. **Replace 0 by Mean and Mean without 0**

- Replace zeros with the mean of the column to avoid having zero values skew the analysis.
- Calculate the mean while excluding zero values and replace zeros accordingly.

### 5. **Change Data Type**

- Convert columns to appropriate data types (e.g., converting a column from string to numeric, or from object to datetime).
